# Module Network System (MNS)

**Module Network System (MNS)** is a **extensible framework** for creating, running, testing, and connecting functional modules that enhance the capabilities of **LLMs** and **AI Agents**.  

MNS acts as the **modular backbone** for AI-driven automation — enabling agents to **discover**, **execute**, and **interact** with purpose-built modules in a **secure**, **scalable** environment.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
|  **Module Registry** | Stores, indexes, and categorizes all modules for easy discovery and retrieval. |
|  **Runtime Environment** | Executes modules in secure, isolated runtimes to ensure safety and performance. |
|  **Module Base Endpoint** | The BII-facing interface that allows agents to directly communicate and execute modules. |
|  **Module Generator** | Dynamically creates new modules from specifications, prompts, or templates. |
|  **Module Testing Unit** | Validates module functionality, security, and compatibility before deployment. |

##  Key Features

- **Dynamic Module Creation** — Generate functional modules on demand.  
- **Secure Execution** — Each module runs in isolated sandboxes.  
- **BII Integration** — Direct, seamless communication between AI Agents and modules.  
- **Scalable & Extensible** — Build, test, and deploy modules for public or private APIs.  
- **Automation-Ready** — Ideal for statistical analysis, data processing, and API orchestration.
